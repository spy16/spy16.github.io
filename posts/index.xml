Producer can decide which partition to publish to by explicitly setting the partition on the message.

These properties or behaviors emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole.
In other words, emergence is an idea that complex behavior can emerge from group of very simple things that interact using a set of very simple rules.
Emergence can be observed in lot of processes of nature.</description></item></channel></rss>
