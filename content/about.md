I am Shivaprasad Bhat. A Software Engineer (Since 2016) from India.

♥️  I love building interesting things. They may not always be useful or unique 😁. Checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/spy16).

👨‍💻 I am a polyglot programmer and can work in Go, Clojure & Python comfortably.

🤯 Neuroscience (and anything about the 🧠) is another strong interest of mine.

Apart from tech & brain things, I also watch a lot of movies & play a lot of **Arma 3** (King of the Hill mainly. Add [me on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/phantom-actual/) if you know what I am [talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwxFrvE0bI4) ) 😎.
