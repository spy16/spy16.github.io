I hate income tax. With that, let's begin.
<!--more-->

Anybody with income is liable for paying income tax [^1]. You might have income from any of the following sources [^2]:

* Salary
* House property - by means of rent
* Capital gain - when you sell a capital asset. stocks, cars, homes, etc. -- basically anything that you sell for profit
* Business
* Other - savings account, FD, gifts received, etc. (This is basically the residual head; anything that couldn't taxed under other sources can be put here 😐)

## Terminology

* Financial Year (FY): 
    * Starting on `April 1st of Year X` to `March 31st of Year X+1`.
    * If your income starts on Dec 2021 it falls in the FY 2021-22.
* Assessment Year (AY): 
    * The FY in which the return of previous year is *assessed*.
    * So for FY 2021-22, the AY will be 2022-23.


[^1]: "Why?!" you might ask - Apparently govt. facilitates and enables you to earn income 😌.
