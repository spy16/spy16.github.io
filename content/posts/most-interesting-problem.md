What scientific problem interests you the most? ðŸ¤” Unification of Physics (A theory of everything)?, Figuring out time travel?, or perhpas Figuring out how to travel faster than speed-of-light? Many would probably say true Artificial Intelligence (or Artificial General Intelligence).

<!--more-->

For me, I think it is figuring out the inner workings of human brain ðŸ§  -- You might ask, is it really that interesting? A 3 pound squishy blob of flesh couldn't possibly beat time travel, right?.

That 3 pound squishy blob of flesh is the most complex system that we know of in the entire known/observable universe ðŸ¤¯.
