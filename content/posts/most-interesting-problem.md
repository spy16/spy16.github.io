What scientific problem interests you the most? ðŸ¤” Unification of Physics (A theory of everything)?, Figuring out time travel?, or perhpas Figuring out how to travel faster than speed-of-light? Many would probably say true Artificial Intelligence (or Artificial General Intelligence).

For me, I think it is figuring out the inner workings of human brain ðŸ§  -- You might ask, is it really that interesting? A 3 pound blob of flesh couldn't possibly beat time travel, right?.

That 3 pound blob of flesh is the most complex system that we know of in the entire known universe ðŸ¤¯. What's interesting is the simplicity hiding under all that complexity and the robustness of the brain.

The complexity of the brain is mainly due to the number of neurons and the size of the network they form. The human brain has approximately 86 billion neurons and the number of connections between them is in trillions. The _simplicity_ part here is that the organisation & function of these cells and the pattern of connections repeat over and over -- It feels like there must be a set of fixed rules each neuron follows and the intelligence, conciousness or the mind simply [emerges](../emergence).

Also, I mentioned _robustness_. What do I mean by that? - Brain has remarkable fault-tolerance. If a part of the brain is lost due to injury (or deliberately removed by [Hemispherectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispherectomy#Results)), it continues working!. You must have also, heard/read that "When one sense is lost, other senses become stronger". This is again another example of robustness of the brain. People who are born blind have hightened sense of hearing -- Because, when the Brain realises the visual part of it is not being used, it simply uses it for something else.

Now, compare that to a computer and think about what would happen if a tiny transistor blew in its circuit.

After reading all this you might still not be convinced that it's more interesting than time travel. But bear with me, because it's not the impressive feat of biology that makes it the most interesting problem. It's what comes after figuring it out.

For a really long time we've been trying to understand "what is mind?", "what is conciousness?", "do we have free will?", and many other fundamental questions that define what it means to be human. Understanding the brain in my opinion would help us get closer to answering all of these questions.
